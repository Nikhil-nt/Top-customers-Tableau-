# Customers costing the company
This real-life scenario involves a scatterplot of customers and a long table. The first requirement was to keep all the customers in the list, but also highlight those customers. After a round of feedback, our stakeholder decided they wanted the selected customers to “surface to the top”.
The selected customers are the ones which were provided good discounts by the company eventually which lead to redcuction in profit ratio.
